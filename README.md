# CherryKitten's Personal Desktop Provisioning Playbook

This is a work in progress playbook that I will use to provision all kinds of desktop devices, running different OS's (at the moment I am aiming for macOS and Debian).

To run this, do:

1. `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`
2. `ansible-playbook -K main.yml`
3. Done!
